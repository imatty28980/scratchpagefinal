            Growing up, my family and I played volleyball a lot for fun. In California, it is a common sport for 
            both men and women. In middle school, I joined the volleyball team, and we only won one game the 
            entire season. It was terrible. But I truly do love the sport so I kept playing. I went on to Junior Varisty
            and Varsity volleyball, and I even won the <span class="black"><span class="bold">"Best Offensive Player"</span></span> award and was on the First Team All-League.

        Volleyball has been a great stress reliever for me in college as well. I am in a class for volleyball, 
        I joined voleyball intramurals, and I continue to play with my family. It truly is the <span class="bold">greatest sport</span> in 
        the world.

                <ul>You cannot get far without a good bump pass right to the setter.</ul>

                <ul>A nice buttery set does just that - it sets you up for success.</ul>
            <li>The Hit</li>
                <ul>Hitting that ball through the block and down into the court. Nothing is quite like it.</ul>
